Vim Plugin that switches between cpp/c++ and .h/hpp files.  It works similarly to [a.vim] and [FSwitch], but it is super simple.

## Installation

This is a [Pathogen] compatible plugin.

# Mapping

```vim
nmap <leader>l :Alt<cr>
```

[a.vim]:http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=31
[FSwitch]:https://github.com/derekwyatt/vim-fswitch
[Pathogen]:http://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen
